Master  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vim-php/phpctags.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/vim-php/phpctags?branch=master)  

An enhanced php [ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) index file generator
compatible with http://ctags.sourceforge.net/FORMAT.

Using [PHP_Parser](https://github.com/nikic/PHP-Parser) as PHP syntax parsing
backend, written in pure PHP. The generated ctags index file contains scope
and access information about class's methods and properties.

This tool was originally developed to enhance the PHP syntax outline surport
for vim [tagbar](http://majutsushi.github.com/tagbar/) plugin. The enhanced
functionality has been included into an addon plugin for tagbar as
[tagbar-phpctags](https://github.com/techlivezheng/tagbar-phpctags).

Enjoy!

* Support php-parser v 0.3
